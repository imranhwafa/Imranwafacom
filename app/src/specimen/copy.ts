// COPY — every user-facing string on the Specimen Sheet, in one
// place. Edit wording here without touching component logic.
//
//   • Plain strings render as-is.
//   • `Seg[]` arrays drive the typewriter / split-italic bits; set
//     `it: true` on a segment to italicise it, `br: true` for a
//     line break (see TypeOnView / renderSegs).
//   • `*Taps` arrays are the rotating quips fired when you tap an
//     otherwise-inert element (see microtaps.tsx).
//
// Structured records (projects, timeline, skills, contacts) live in
// data.ts; feature/easter-egg strings live in site-config.ts.
